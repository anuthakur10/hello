1. What is React.js?
Example Answer: React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application state effectively.

2. What are the key features of React.js?
Example Answer: Key features include:

Component-Based Architecture: Allows for the creation of reusable UI components.
Virtual DOM: Improves performance by updating only the changed parts of the DOM.
Declarative UI: Makes it easier to reason about and debug the UI.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Ensures a predictable state management pattern.
3. Explain the concept of a component in React.
Example Answer: A component in React is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates the logic, structure, and styling of a part of the user interface. Components can be either class-based or functional and can accept inputs (props) and manage their own state.

4. What is JSX?
Example Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is transpiled into JavaScript by tools like Babel. JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI within the JavaScript code.

5. How does React handle state management?
Example Answer: React handles state management through component state. In class components, you use this.state and this.setState(), while in functional components, the useState hook is used to manage state. For complex state management, libraries like Redux or the Context API can be used.

6. What is the difference between state and props in React?
Example Answer:

State: Managed within a component and can change over time. It is used to store data that affects the component’s behavior and rendering.
Props: Short for properties, they are read-only and passed from parent to child components. They are used to pass data and event handlers to child components.
7. Explain the lifecycle methods in React class components.
Example Answer: React class components have lifecycle methods such as:

componentDidMount(): Called after the component is mounted.
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Called after the component updates.
componentWillUnmount(): Called before the component is removed from the DOM.
8. What is the Virtual DOM?
Example Answer: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize updates to the real DOM. It compares the Virtual DOM to the previous version using a diffing algorithm and updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed.

9. What is the purpose of the key prop in React?
Example Answer: The key prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list. It helps React efficiently update and re-render components by keeping track of which items have changed, been added, or removed.

10. What are React Hooks?
Example Answer: React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Common hooks include useState for state management and useEffect for side effects such as data fetching.

11. Explain the useState hook.
Example Answer: The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that state.

jsx
Copy code
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
12. How does useEffect work?
Example Answer: The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function that runs after every render, or conditionally based on dependencies passed as a second argument.

jsx
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run on mount and update
}, [dependencies]);
13. What is the Context API?
Example Answer: The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to manage global state and pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

14. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
Example Answer:

Controlled Components: Form inputs that are controlled by React state. The value of the input is bound to the component's state.
Uncontrolled Components: Form inputs that maintain their own state internally and are accessed using refs.
15. What is React Router?
Example Answer: React Router is a library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define multiple routes in your application and navigate between them without reloading the page.

16. How do you optimize performance in a React application?
Example Answer: Performance can be optimized through:

Memoization: Using React.memo for components and useMemo or useCallback hooks to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Code Splitting: Using dynamic imports to load components only when needed.
Virtualization: Rendering only the visible portion of large lists using libraries like react-window.
17. What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?
Example Answer: Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They are used to reuse component logic.

18. Explain the concept of lifting state up.
Example Answer: Lifting state up is the process of moving state to a common ancestor component to share data or functionality between child components. This way, the parent component manages the state and passes it down to child components via props.

19. What is Redux?
Example Answer: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage global state in a predictable way using actions, reducers, and a store. It works well with React through the react-redux bindings.

20. What is the purpose of reducers in Redux?
Example Answer: Reducers are pure functions in Redux that specify how the state of the application changes in response to an action. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state.

21. What is the difference between componentDidMount and useEffect?
Example Answer:

componentDidMount is a lifecycle method used in class components to run code after the component mounts.
useEffect is a hook used in functional components to perform side effects after every render or based on dependency changes.
22. How do you handle forms in React?
Example Answer: Forms in React can be handled through controlled or uncontrolled components. Controlled components use state to manage form input values, while uncontrolled components use refs to access form data.

23. What are error boundaries?
Example Answer: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

24. Explain the use of React.Fragment.
Example Answer: React.Fragment is used to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It helps avoid unnecessary wrapping elements.

jsx
Copy code
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <Child1 />
    <Child2 />
  </React.Fragment>
);
25. What is the significance of shouldComponentUpdate?
Example Answer: shouldComponentUpdate is a lifecycle method in class components that determines whether a component should re-render. It is used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

26. How can you handle asynchronous operations in React?
Example Answer: Asynchronous operations can be handled using the useEffect hook for functional components, or lifecycle methods like componentDidMount in class components. Additionally, libraries like Axios can be used for making HTTP requests.

27. What is React's useMemo hook?
Example Answer: The useMemo hook is used to memoize the result of a computation, which helps optimize performance by preventing expensive calculations on every render.

jsx
Copy code
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
28. What is useCallback used for?
Example Answer: The useCallback hook returns a memoized version of a callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful for passing stable callback functions to optimized child components.

jsx
Copy code
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // callback logic
}, [dependencies]);
29. What is React's useReducer hook?
Example Answer: The useReducer hook is an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic. It works similarly to Redux by using a reducer function to handle state transitions.

jsx
Copy code
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
30. What is the purpose of React.StrictMode?
Example Answer: React.StrictMode is a wrapper component that helps find potential
